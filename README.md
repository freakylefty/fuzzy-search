# Fuzzy Search

A little project to start leaning Python, by making a fuzzy search system based on the one used in [Debuginator](https://github.com/Srekel/the-debuginator), described [here](https://medium.com/@Srekel/implementing-a-fuzzy-search-algorithm-for-the-debuginator-cacc349e6c55)

More details to come when I'm not just setting the repo up.
